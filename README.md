### Hi, I'm Emily! I code and I creatively write.

I studied computer science 👩🏻‍💻 with a minor in creative writing 📝 at Rutgers University. I currently work on the product management team at [NetGalley](https://www.netgalley.com/).

In my free time, I like working on web applications and other projects that combine my technical skills with my various interests in the arts! Explore my Github profile to see what I've worked on and am currently working on right now!
